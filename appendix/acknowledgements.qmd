This course was inspired by **Luke W. Johnston** and **Anders Askeland**
R-cubed's courses, in collaboration with the Danish Diabetes and
Endocrinology Academy. Its design and style owe in part to these
courses, reflecting a commitment to comprehensive and engaging teaching
methods. We extend our gratitude for their foundational work, which
significantly influenced the development of this course.

We also thank the following individuals for their review and feedback.
